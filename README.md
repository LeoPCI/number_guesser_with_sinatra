# number_guesser_with_sinatra

This is a simple web application built with Sinatra that will pick a random number, and let you guess what it is. It will tell you whether you are high or low, and by how much.
To launch the program, simply run 'web_guesser.rb' in your terminal and visit localhost:4567.
